The sky diagram component has three required graphics: moon.svg, sun.svg, and ground.svg.


=== moon.svg ===

Requirements:
- exported SVG must be 80x80px (i.e. viewBox="0 0 80 80"),
- moon disc must be 80px in diameter and centered.

The moon graphic will be masked to indicate phase. The actual displayed size depends on the sunAndMoonSize parameter and the diagram's size.


=== sun.svg ===

Requirements:
- exported SVG must be 120x120px (i.e. viewBox="0 0 120 120"),
- sun disc must be 80px in diameter and centered.

The extra space allows drawing rays or other effects. The actual displayed size depends on the sunAndMoonSize parameter and the diagram's size. I found that I needed a transparent background to enforce the size and centering requirements.


=== ground.svg ===

The ground layer graphic is scaled such that:
- it takes 100% of the diagram width,
- the bottom half goes from the bottom of the diagram to the horizon level, with the upper half above the horizon level, allowing a wavy horizon.

The ground graphic's aspect ratio will usually not be preserved.
